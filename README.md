**Singleton Pattern**

*Intent*

Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

*Usage*

1) There must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point.

2) When the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code

*Application*

Setting a unique origin in the N-D Euclidean Plane

**Strategy Pattern**
